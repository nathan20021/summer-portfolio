# Introduction

## **👋 Hi there! Welcome to my tech repository**

I'm a senior university student, back-end developer, tech enthusiast, and aspiring software architect.
Throughout my co-op and leadership experiences, I realized the power of connections and mentorship within the tech space!

## **🤔 Why does this repository exists?**

Witnessing lots of students, full of great potential, yet struggling with their starting point. I noticed a big problem:

> Students are **NOT** exposed to industry-standard technologies at school, yet mastering these technologies is the only way to get jobs.

In another word, purely focussing on school material will give students an extremely hard time getting their first job.

Obviously, some courses are fundamental to the craft of software development (Data Structure and Algorithm, OOP, Theory of Computation, ...). However, students will understand them in depth by taking a more hands-on approach.

> Therefore, through this platform, I'm aiming to **speed up student's learning** journey in becoming a job-ready software engineer, at the same time sharing about all things back-end.

## **🤔 Which topics will be covered?**

### **Technical Topics**

My site will cover a lot of back-end fundamentals that a lot of programmers skip during their learning careers. Future topics will include:

- Communication Protocols (https, wss, quic)
- HTTP versions comparison (1.1, 2.0, 3.0)
- HTTP servers (Nginx, Apache)
- Back-end framework comparison (Django, Flask, Node, Spring Boot)
- Useful Apache Projects (Maven, Flink, Kafka, Spark, Superset, Airflow, Zookeeper, Hadoop)
- Fundamental AWS services (S3, Lambda, Elastic beanstalk, CloudFront)
- Containerization and Ochestration (Docker, K8S, Apache Mesos)
- Microservices architectural patterns (Too many patterns to list here 🙁🙁)

### **Non-technical Topics**

Aiming to help students landing their first tech job as fast as possible, some articles will be dedicate to:

- How to build up and develop your network from zero.
- Becoming a back-end developer from zero (The fast way).
- A different way of looking at university / college.
- What to do when you have zero job experience.
